public class AppMain {
    // The program should...
    //  Setup a series of duels (creature vs creature). In each duel, there is one winner.
    // The winner of the duel goes on to face the next random creature. 

    // All creatures have names, health (integer), strength (integer), and a probability of hitting.
    // There are three types of creatures. 
    //  StrongCreature - Has a health of 50, strength of 30, and a 50% chance to damage.
    //  FastCreature - Has a health of 50, strength of 15, and a 50% chance to damage. 
    //                 The FastCreature has a special feature: it can attack twice during each round of the duel.
    //  AccurateCreature - Has a health of 50 and a strength of 20, and a 80% chance to damage.
    //                 The AccurateCreature has a special feature: if it damages, it has a 20% chance to double its damage.

    // During the duel, creatures take turns trying to hit each other.
    //  CreatureA has a chance to hit, if it does then its opponents health is reduced by its strength.
    //  CreatureB then has a chance to hit, same rules apply.
    //  If at any point either creature has reached zero health, then they are defeated.
    // When a winner is found, that creature goes on. Its health is restored to its original before the next duel.

    // There are 8 creatures in the arena that will duel (this is also the order they enter the arena)...
    //  Fluffletuft (Strong), Whiskerwhisp (Accurate), Fuzzlenook (Strong), Shagglewisp (Fast), 
    //  Puffernip (Fast), Tanglethorn (Accurate), Quillfluff (Strong), Snugglewight (Fast)

    // You are implementing a portion of this program. A portion is provided for you.
    //  Each portion you are responsible for is marked with a TODO. 
    //  They are located...
    //      Arena.nextCreature()   <-- you must finish this method
    //      AccurateCreature.java  <-- you must create this file/class

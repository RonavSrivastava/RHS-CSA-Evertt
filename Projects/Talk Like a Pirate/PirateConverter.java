/* There are some specific rules that your code needs to follow...
 *  1. Replace words as follows. 
 *      hello -> ahoy 
 *      my -> me
 *      friend -> bucko
 *      sir -> matey
 *      stranger -> scurvy dog
 *      where -> whar
 *      is -> be
 *      the -> th'
 *      you -> ye
 *      old -> barnacle covered
 *  2. If a word begins with a capital letter, then when you translate it, it should also begin with a 
 *      capital letter. Ignore the case of the rest of the word. 
 *      Examples...
 *          translate "Where" / "WHERE" / "WhErE" / "WhERE" / etc. as "Whar", 
 *              but translate "where" / "wHERE" / "wHeRe" / "wHere" / etc. as "whar". 
 *          You should only output "Whar" or "whar" as a translation for any form of "where",
 *              none of the other letters in "Whar" or "whar" should ever be capitalized apart from 
 *              possibly the first. 
 * 3. Pirates have a habit of saying "Arrr". Start your pirate text with "Arrr! ".
